## Before You Start

**Have you completed Part A (Essential Pre-Class)?**
- ✓ Understand the 3 pillars: Perception, Design, Storytelling
- ✓ Know the golden rule (bar charts start at 0)
- ✓ Review common mistakes to avoid
- ✓ Consider: Who is your audience?

If not, please review [Pre-Class Guide - Part A](./pre-class.md) (30 minutes).

**Technical Setup:**
- Conda environment: `pds` 
- Notebook file: `notebooks/data_visualization_lesson.ipynb`
- Open in VSCode and select `pds` kernel

## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Data Storytelling (Conceptual)
**Duration:** 30-40 minutes | **Interaction:** Slides + Discussion

**What you'll learn:**
- Why storytelling matters in data visualization
- The three-act structure applied to data
- How to choose what to visualize (context, problem, action)
- Connecting audience to outcome

**During this part:**
- Watch slides and follow along with examples
- Think about: "What story am I trying to tell?"
- Notice: How does the narrative frame the data?

### Part 2: Data Visualization in Python (Hands-On)
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes | **Interaction:** Code-along in notebook

**Open:** `notebooks/data_visualization_lesson.ipynb`

**What you'll learn:**
- Matplotlib fundamentals (setup, figures, subplots, customization)
- Statistical graphs with seaborn (distributions, relationships, categorical)
- Linking visualization principles to code
- Making publication-quality plots

**During this part:**
- Code along with instructor (don't just watch)
- Try modifying parameters to see what changes
- Connect each visualization to principles from Part 1
  - "Why did we choose a bar chart here?"
  - "How does color help pre-attentive processing?"
  - "What story does this visualization tell?"

**Notebook sections:**
1. **Setup & Imports** — Understanding the visualization stack
2. **Matplotlib Primer** — Basic structure (Figure → Axes → Plot)
3. **Seaborn Fundamentals** — Statistical visualization patterns
4. **Applied Examples** — Real-world visualization scenarios
5. **Customization & Polish** — Making publication-quality plots
